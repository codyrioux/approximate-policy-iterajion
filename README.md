# approximate-policy-iterajion

An implementation of Approximate Policy Iteration (API) from the paper Lagoudakis et. al. 2003.

This algorithm approximates a policy for solving very large Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
in a parallel fashion. I plan on using it for part of a larger project, however this component itself is
very reusable so I factored it out into a library.

Please note that it is *currnetly untested* as I have not programmed the rest of the problem to which it
is intended to be applied. Once it has been successfuly applied to a problem I will be submitting it
to clojars.

So please bear in mind this code is *NOT* ready to use!

## Usage

To write when the project matures a bit...
